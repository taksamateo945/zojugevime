Often shortened to MS, it refers to a disease that affects the brain and nervous system. There are a number of things that aren’t yet fully understood about it, but scientists have made great progress in researching the condition in more recent years. In fact, there was a time when being diagnosed with MS was practically a death sentence. Today, there is still no cure for the disease, but it is possible to manage it and its associated complications far more effectively. The truth of the matter is that a person can have MS without you ever even knowing that they are suffering from the condition. If you have doubts about that fact, you may be interested to know that there are a number of celebrities who suffer from it. Below is a list of<a href=# rel=noopener> 20 celebrities</a> who do, along with some important facts and background about the disease itself.</p><h2>What Causes MS?</h2><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, MS is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body begins to attack the protective covering, or sheath, that surrounds the <a href=# rel=noopener>brain and spinal cord</a>. Although the entire process isn’t yet well understood, scientists believe that there are a number of factors that could potentially contribute to the disease. What is understood so far is that it essentially makes it more difficult for signals to get from a person’s brain to other parts of their body. Some people experience severe symptoms, even to the point of being confined to a wheelchair and others experience symptoms that are much more mild. Of course, it is possible for someone who has experienced moderate to severe symptoms of MS to go into remission where they have a period of relative calm that doesn’t see the disease progressing a great deal. By the same token, it’s also possible for an individual who has traditionally experienced fairly mild symptoms to have a setback where those symptoms suddenly become far more severe. As is the case with most diseases, the key to managing MS as effectively as possible is early detection and careful management. The sooner that you get diagnosed, the easier it is for effective treatment to be started that could potentially mitigate the symptoms, even though it isn’t possible to cure the disease itself. By the same token, carefully managing the disease and taking care of oneself is a key component of following its progression as much as possible.</p><h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2><p>Some of the earliest signs of multiple sclerosis can easily be mistaken for other diseases. This is one of the reasons that it is <a href=# rel=noopener>so frequently missed.</a> Some of the earliest symptoms may include pain throughout the body, numbness and vision problems. By the same token, a person may find it difficult to concentrate on things or may even have bladder issues that can’t be explained and haven’t occurred before. At times, movement may be difficult or there may be a tingling in the extremities that can’t be explained or relieved. Of course, not everyone suffers from all of these symptoms and in some cases, they don’t present with hardly any of the classic symptoms.</p><h2>Celebrities Who Suffer From MS</h2><p>As previously mentioned, there are a number of celebrities who suffer from the disease. Some have symptoms that are more severe than others. There are<a href=# rel=noopener> several notable celebrities</a> who work on a routine basis and appear to be perfectly healthy. As a matter of fact, you will probably be surprised at some of the names on this list. Here are 20 of them who are affected by multiple sclerosis.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-81275701-750x482.jpg alt="Alan Osmond" width=750 height=482 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>1. Alan Osmond</h2><p>You might recognize this name as the individual who is one of the founding members of the Osmond family, individuals who have been performing for decades. Years ago, he was diagnosed with a rare form of multiple sclerosis. Although he has struggled with the disease from time to time, he has also managed it fairly well, especially given the fact that it’s not as common as the type of MS that strikes most people. Therefore, doctors have had to work extra hard to keep the condition in check as much as possible.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shutterstock_1391533412-750x500.jpg alt="David Osmond" width=750 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>2. David Osmond</h2><p>David Osmond is Alan Osmond’s son and he was diagnosed with the most common form of multiple sclerosis when he was only 26 years of age. Much like his father, he has struggled with bouts of the disease that were far more severe at times than others. That said, he too has managed to keep it in check fairly well. In fact, both father and son are still very active in the performance arena and by all accounts, it seems that they have plans to continue their endeavors for as long as possible.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shutterstock_22900726-750x500.jpg alt="Art Alexakis" width=750 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>3. Art Alexakis</h2><p>You may be familiar with this name through the band that he fronts, Everclear. He was diagnosed in 2016 and chose to openly share that fact with his fans three years later. As it turns out, he wasn’t diagnosed until he was involved in an automobile accident. He went to the doctor complaining of numbness, believing it was a direct result of the automobile accident, only to find that he actually had MS. He was also told that he had had the disease for anywhere from ten to twenty years without even knowing it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shutterstock_106637141-750x497.jpg alt="Ann Romney" width=750 height=497 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>4. Ann Romney</h2><p>The wife of politician Mitt Romney, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis as far back as 1998. She has remained active throughout her entire diagnosis, and has in fact made it her mission in life to bring awareness to the disease as much as possible. To that end, she works tirelessly to make others aware of it and raise money for additional research in hopes of one day finding a cure.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-455125008-750x500.jpg alt="Teri Garr" width=750 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>5. Teri Garr</h2><p>Actress Teri Garr was also diagnosed with the disease quite some time ago, back in 1999. She never said anything about it publicly until 2002 but has since that time worked to make others more aware of it. She also says that she felt symptoms of the disease as far back as 1983. At the time, she didn’t know what it was but she did notice that there were times when she didn’t feel well. Once she was diagnosed, she was able to put it all together and realize that she had probably had the disease for several years before she was ever diagnosed with it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1187709110-750x500.jpg alt="Neil Cavuto" width=750 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>6.

Montel Williams</h2><p>Talk show host <a href=# rel=noopener>Montel Williams</a> went public with his diagnosis in 1999. At the time, he said that he had been suffering from the disease for 20 years before he ever went public. He also said that it took the first 10 years of that time for doctors to diagnose him correctly. Unfortunately, he was misdiagnosed with a number of other diseases during the first 10 years so he didn’t receive proper treatment until much later.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shutterstock_1425875225-750x500.jpg alt="Jamie Lynn-Sigler" width=750 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>8.

She also says that she struggles with stairs and she has to consciously think about every step in order to make that effort in order to get from place to place because her muscles simply don’t work as well as they used to.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shutterstock_123544633-750x500.jpg alt="Jack Osbourne" width=750 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>9.

At the same time, she says that the rest of her body is always cold, even to the point of shivering.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shutterstock_386916817-750x513.jpg alt="Christina Applegate" width=750 height=513 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>11.
