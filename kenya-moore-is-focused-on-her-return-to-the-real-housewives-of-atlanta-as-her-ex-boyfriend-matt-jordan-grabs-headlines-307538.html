Kenya knows that she was made for reality TV and is so excited to share her life with viewers again. Kenya is keeping it real and not holding anything back at all yet again. She can’t wait to show Brooklyn off to all the viewers.”</p><p>The person added: “She’s truly enjoying spending time with Porsha [Williams, 38, another housewife on RHOA] who is also a new mommy. The girls laugh at how far they’ve come in their friendship and how close they are. She also loves spending time with Kandi [Burruss, 43] and Cynthia [Bailey, 52].”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Moore is married to Marc Daly and they have a daughter together, Brooklyn.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmru6rYympqiqlWK2tHnFqJquq5WZerC6jKGcq2WimsG2vs1mq6hlpJ2ybr7EmqNmoJ%2BqwKbDyK%2BcrGWfm3qiwMuapa2ZXZbAbrTEq2SesF2XvLqy0aKcp5xdoq61wIyjpquckaN6qL7Am6pmoJWWsa21zZ6qZmtgbIJ0hI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10042870-report-no-1-pick-jackson-holliday-orioles-agree-to-record-contract-for-hs-player.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Report: No. 1 Pick Jackson Holliday, Orioles Agree to 'Record' Contract for HS Player | News, Scores">&larr;
