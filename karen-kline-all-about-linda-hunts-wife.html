Born in 1951 and 72 years old, Kline and Hunt have been together for more than three decades, although it was only in 2008 that they got married.</strong></p><p>Karen is a former therapist whose fame is tied to her better half of many years. While they have given some snippets into their love life and how they have managed to be together since the 1980s, details about the personal life of Kline have been all but kept away from public knowledge.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Karen Kline’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name</strong>: Karen Kline</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 1951</li><li><strong>Karen Kline’s Age:</strong> 72 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong>: Lesbian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Karen Kline’s Wife:</strong> Linda Hunt</li><li><strong>Karen Kline’s Net worth</strong>: $3 million</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the wife of Linda Hunt</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Karen Kline?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>While there are many sources that claim Karen Kline was born in 1944, the truth is that she was actually born in 1951, although the exact date of her birth still remains unknown. This means that she is now 72 years old and six years younger than her lover, Linda Hunt, as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> by the actress.</p><p>Of American nationality and white ethnicity, she was birthed in the United States, which was also where she was brought up. Details regarding her childhood and education have all remained elusive, just as information about her family members.</p><p>Her more popular better half, Linda Hunt, was born Lydia Susanna Hunt on April 2, 1945, which means she is 78 years old. The actress was brought up in New Jersey by her parents, Raymond Davy Hunt and Elsie Doying Hunt, alongside an older brother.</p><p>When she was a teenager, she was diagnosed with a form of a condition known as hypopituitary dwarfism, which has stunted her growth to only 4 feet 9 inches. She got her education from the Interlochen Arts Academy as well as DuPaul University, which at the time, was known as the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><h2><strong>What Does Karen Kline Do For A Living?</strong></h2><p>Karen Kline is a retired therapist who is now living a very quiet life with her partner. On her own part, Linda Hunt is an actress who does not need any introduction. She has had a very long career as a theater, film, and TV actress for more than five decades.</p><p>She started out in the theatre in 1972 when she was in her late twenties. Her first recorded work was in the stage production of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet. She would appear in more productions, including Top Girls and The Cherry Orchard, in 1984 and 1988, respectively.</p><p>Her TV credit dates back to 1976 when she appeared in an episode of Great Performances. Her other shows include The Room Upstairs (1987) and NCIS: Los Angeles, which ran from 2009 to 2023.</p><p>As a film actress, Linda Hunt has had a fulfilling career that began in 1980 when she took part in Popeye. Two years later, she would be in The Year of Living Dangerously, which would be one of her most historic works as it earned her an <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Oscars</a> award as the first person to clinch an Academy Award for playing a character of the opposite sex.</p><h2><b>When Did Karen Kline and Linda Hunt Start Dating?</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/05/Karen-Kline-and-Linda-Hunt.jpg><p>The love story between Karen and the famous<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> American actress</a> is one that has lasted for many years. Details as regards how they met are not clear, but it has been suggested that they might have met through a mutual friend or from an event, thanks to their shared interest in psychology.</p><p>Whatever the circumstances of their meeting, the first thing that attracted Kline to Hunt was not what would attract many people to their partners. It was the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">corduroys</a> of Linda that became Kline’s fascination.</p><p>There were some things that placed the two women in contrasting places to each other such as six years age gap, as well as their massive height difference. Nonetheless, they still found a way of falling in love and remaining as a couple since then. Hunt once joked about their age difference, stating that she forgave her partner for being six years younger than her.</p><h2><strong>When Did Karen Kline Become Linda Hunt’s Wife?</strong></h2><p>Karen Kline and Linda Hunt got married in 2014. It took them a while to work down the aisle, and this is likely due to their circumstances at the time. When they started their relationship, same-sex relationships were not things that were accepted or popular. However, they still managed to remain together for many years and eventually got married</p><p>Even before they got married, the couple had already started living together in the 1980s in Los Angeles. By the time the two started dating and living together, Linda Hunt had already started her career in Hollywood.</p><p>She had established herself as a theatre actress, and she began her film career with productions such as the aforementioned Popeye in 1980 and then her breakout role in the 1982 film, The Year of Living Dangerously, which earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress.</p><p>Following their marriage, it was reported in 2014 that they were now living in a bungalow in Los Angeles, the same city where they had been for many years. Their home has been described as whimsical and with a special kind of elegance.</p><p>More so, it is said to be well-detailed with great finishing. The welcoming home of Karen Kline and Linda Hunt is also described as jewel-box-filled with graphic wall covering and other things that made it a standout house.</p><h2><strong>Does Karen Kline Have Kids?</strong></h2><p>Even though the couple has been together for many years and they seem to be very much in love, it is known that Karen Kline and Linda Hunt do not have any children together. In the same way, neither of them has ever had any kids from any previous relationships.</p><p>Both Karen and Lina have chosen to remain silent about not having kids, but it is believed that it is most likely because they are not interested. As it stands, with both of them already over 70 years old, biology may not allow any of them to take in if they change their minds about having kids, and they do not seem to be interested in adopting kids.</p><p>Instead, the lovers share their home with three dogs which they adopted a long time ago. The pets have formed a part of their small family.</p><h2><b>FAQs&nbsp;</b></h2><h3><strong>What Is Karen Kline’s Age?</strong></h3><p>Karen Kline is currently 72 years old, as she was born in 1951.</p><h3><strong>What Is Karen Kline’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>The net worth of Karen Kline is estimated at $3 million, while that of her partner, Linda Hunt, is put at over<span class="YrbPuc WGKbId BBwThe">&nbsp;</span><span class="wHYlTd z8gr9e">$12 Million.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLiivsSnZKSkmaOybq3LpWSamp%2BqwW64yKebmmWYqru1v4ywoJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./david-visentin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Visentin">&larr;
