Lumko was a fighter, and I'm speaking this from a creative point of view.

She said:</p>"As much as we can say they had an opinion on everything, I think in this industry it is very important to have that opinion. They were fearless in their opinion. I think that's a beautiful lesson to learn because that's what the arts are, that's what the art gives us and that's what Lumko gave us.”<p></p><p class=align-left>Public figure <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Makoto Phumodi </a>looked back fondly on the last time they were with Lumko 4 months ago.

She continued:</p>“No one in here can tell me that the seed they took from Lumko's tree didn't do them good. All of you know what the seed you picked from Lumko's tree did for you, even me standing here, I know Lumko's goodness in my life and not only that but in my career. "<p class=align-left>Makoto described Johnson's talent when they wrote <i>Tequila AF and </i>took 30 minutes to put together five character bibles.
