"But I can assure you that we prepare each week the way that you're supposed to prepare, and I like the fact that our team knows how to do that."</span></span></p><p><span><span>On Wednesday, Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich issued a statement on the investigation, per Bruce Feldman of Fox Sports:</span></span></p><p><span><span>The ACC would also release a statement on Wednesday, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Crawford</a> of WDRB in Louisville:</span></span></p><p>Protecting competitive integrity is fundamental to the Atlantic Coast Conference. The conference office is in the process of obtaining the internal findings from Wake Forest University. Based on the information provided, and any other information obtained, the league office will perform its due diligence, and as necessary, additional discussions and actions will occur.</p><p><span>"We were contacted by Wake Forest," Army athletic director Boo Corrigan said in a phone interview with </span>Sports Illustrated' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Thamel</a> on Wednesday<span>. "</span><span>We're looking into it."</span></p><p><span>Corrigan would not elaborate further, per Thamel.</span></p><p><span>On Thursday, Virginia Tech athletic director Whit Babcock told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thamel</a> the university had been contacted as part of the probe as well. He said the school was "disappointed and embarrassed."</span></p><p><span>Former Virginia Tech head coach <a href=#>Frank Beamer</a> also released a statement:</span></p>Virginia Tech Football <span class=acct>@VT_Football</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Statement from former Head Coach Frank Beamer https://t.co/VUhsaCeF9x</p><p><span><span>Elrod previously served as an assistant coach for the Wake Forest football team for 11 seasons under former boss Jim Grobe, but he did not return after </span><span>Dave Clawson took over as head coach in 2014.</span></span></p><p><span>Clawson expressed his disappointment in Elrod's actions Tuesday, per the school's press release (via Blogger So Dear):</span></p><p id=Qufw7T>I am extremely disappointed that our confidential and proprietary game preparation was compromised. It's incomprehensible that a former Wake Forest student-athlete, graduate-assistant, full-time football coach, and current radio analyst for the school, would betray his alma mater. We allowed him to have full access to our players, team functions, film room, and practices. He violated our trust which negatively impacted our entire program. I am glad we have taken steps to ensure it will not happen in the future. At this point, this is a matter for [athletic director] Ron Wellman and others to act on. My staff and I are focused on Temple and preparing the team for the Military Bowl.</p><p>Despite Elrod's meddling, the Demon Deacons (6-6) have six wins for the second time in the last eight seasons. In fact, Wake's six wins in 2016 equaled the total the team combined to post during Clawson's first two years as head coach.</p><p>Looking ahead, Clawson and Co. will attempt to put the bizarre storyline in the rearview mirror as they prepare for a Dec. 27 Military Bowl clash with the Temple Owls.</p><p>If the Demon Deacons come out on top, it will represent the program's first bowl win since Grobe led Wake Forest past Navy in the 2008 EagleBank Bowl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9wYWx%2FcnnFqKmmnaJixKK3xGadqKqVqMFurdKsoKyskaPBbsDOpqSyZZWhv7CwjKmpqK6ZmbKlecaapJ5loKGur3nTqGSoqKCku6a606w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./145570-videos-married-lerato-kgangago-locking-lips-young-famous-african-star-naked-dj-a-stir.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Videos of Married Lerato Kganyago Locking Lips With Young, Famous &amp;amp; African Star Naked DJ Caus">&larr;
