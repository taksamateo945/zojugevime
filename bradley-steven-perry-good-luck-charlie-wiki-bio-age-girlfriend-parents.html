He is an actor, probably best known for his role of Gabe Duncan in the “Good Luck Charlie” sitcom aired on the Disney Channel. Bradley was home-schooled, and is still currently living in Southern California with his parents, Emery Emannuel and Brenda, his three older sisters – Madison, Justine and Makenzie – and his dog called Gidgit.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wanna know how to <a rel=nofollow href=#>#getmorehappy</a>? Eat a churro. <a rel=nofollow href=#>#disneyland</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>@Disneyland</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/vAuUEktzmg</a></p><p>— Bradley Steven Perry (@bradley_s_perry) <a rel=nofollow href=#>February 17, 2018</a></p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Bradley didn’t have a typical childhood as he started acting when he was just 10 – his first roles were in movies such as <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Choose Connor”</a> and “Magnificent Max”. At the age of 11, he appeared in his first TV series “Without a Trace” in which he had a main role in a single episode. Then in 2009, he had a couple of roles in comedy movies including “The Goods: Live Hard”, “Opposite Day” and “Old Dogs”.</p><p>In 2010, he appeared in the <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Good Luck Charlie”</a> family sitcom, which turned out to be his most notable role out of all that he has had in his 12 years long career. In 2011, they made a movie based on the “Good Luck Charlie” sitcom – “Good Luck Charlie, It’s Christmas” – and the writers wanted Bradley to play the same role as in the sitcom. During the same year, he had a main role in “Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure”, in which he played young dog owner.</p><p>Some of his other notable roles include in the “Pants on Fire” movie shot in 2014, “Might Med” TV series (2015) and “Descendants: Wicked World” TV series in 2017. Bradley hasn’t appeared on TV screens since his role as Donald in “Speechless” in 2017.</p><p></p><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>Bradley seems to love playing baseball as he is a part of a local baseball team, and is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox, as well as the New England Patriots American Football team, even appearing in an “NBC Sunday Night Football” TV promo as ‘The Patriots Kid’.</p><p>Even though he is still very young, this hasn’t stopped him from donating his money to charity – he is currently working with Mattel Children’s hospital which treats children who are suffering from pediatric diseases, the “Toys for Tots” organization which gifts toys to underprivileged children when it’s Christmas time, and the “Make-a-Wish Foundation”, which helps children suffering from life-threatening medical conditions.</p><p>He was in a one year long relationship with <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sabrina Carpenter</a>, who is famous for her role in “Girl Meets World” – apparently, he asked her out by writing a note which he then put in a glass bottle – Sabrina thought how that was very sweet and accepted his invitation. They kept posting pictures of themselves together on their Instagram accounts, but they split by the end of 2015. There are rumors that he is now going out with both Sarah Gilman and Paris Berelc, while other rumors say that he is in a relationship with Camryn Frederickson – none of these have been confirmed by the actor.</p><p>Bradley is a huge fan of <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Rick and Morty”</a>, the adult animated science fiction sitcom which follows the adventures (and mis-adventures) of a brilliant and cynical mad scientist called Rick Sanchez and his stupid but good-hearted grandson Morty Smith while they travel between worlds and dimensions. The series has three seasons with 30 episodes so far, and a contract has been signed with AdultSwim for another 70 episodes. Bradley especially loves Rick and the fact that he doesn’t care about other people or their opinions – he often quotes Rick, as you can see on his Instagram and Twitter accounts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cmj5oLTVIAAXLe9-819x1024.jpg><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Bradley is only 20 years old. He has short brown hair, brown eyes and is 5ft 6ins (1.71m) tall and weighs around 143lbs (65kg) – his vital statistics are 39-12-34.</p><p>According to authoritative sources, Bradley’s net worth is estimated to be over $2 million, much of which he has earned from his role in “Good Luck Charlie”.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Since Bradley is a part of today’s modern society, he keeps up with his peers and is more than just popular on social media platforms – he has an <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a> account with more than two million followers and 341 post, and his description reads ‘”I’m sorry but your opinion means very little to me” – Rick Sanchez’. He is also very active on Twitter – he first joined in April 2010, and has so far amassed nearly a million followers and tweeted almost 4,000 times. His Facebook page is followed by 215,000 people.</p><h2><span id=Awards>Awards</span></h2><p>Bradley was nominated two times for Young Artist Award for the Best Performance in a TV Series – Supporting Young Actor in 2011 and 2012 for his appearance in “Good Luck Charlie – sadly, he didn’t win either of them.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><p>Bradley loves spending time in his kayak during summer, going to adventure parks, and he is also a snowboarder as he claims to be an adrenaline addict.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOm6manJyaxm6%2F056tnqZdpbKzvthmnqinlGK5tq%2FKZpqhmaKhtqZ51qKiomWSnrxurcaeZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmqJGnsq%2FA0mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kayla-kosuga-net-worth-and-earnings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kayla Kosuga Net Worth and Earnings">&larr;
