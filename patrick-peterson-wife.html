Afterwards, they started dating after falling in love. They got engaged after two years of dating.</p><p>A few months later, when they received their university degrees, the pair made the decision to wed, and on June 12, 2012, Patrick turned 22.</p><p>Several well-known Americans, including many of Paterson’s former colleagues from LSU and the Cardinals, attended their wedding ceremony, which was held at the Roosevelt New Orleans Hotel.</p><p>Patrick and Antique travelled extensively after their wedding to spend private time together.</p><p>The couple’s gorgeous children Paityn and Parker Peterson were born a few years later.</p><p>The two met at a number of big occasions, but they haven’t revealed any details about their romantic relationship.</p><p>The couple avoids social media as much as possible. They occasionally post pictures of themselves and their kids together on social media to express their affection for one another.</p><p>The Petersons are also interested in charitable work; they recently visited Haiti to aid the locals.</p><h3>Who is Antique Paterson?</h3><p>On October 12th, Antique Paterson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. Realtor Jeanell Larry is her mother.</p><p>Bryan Thomas, known as the proprietor of BEE-Cutz Barbershop in Marrero, Louisiana, proposed to her and they were married.</p><p>As Antique has not officially identified her father, it is still unclear if he is her biological father.</p><p>Anthony Jr. and Courtney T. Larry Sr., Peterson’s siblings, were there during her formative years.</p><p>She has a strong relationship with them. Antiques attended Edna Karr High School in New Orleans, Louisiana, back in the day.</p><p>She enrolled in Louisiana State University after completing her prior education, where she later met her future husband and earned a 2011 degree in microbiology.</p><p>Peterson started medical school at the Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine at Midwestern University.</p><p>At St. Joseph’s Hospital in Phoenix, she began her three-year residency after completing medical school in 2018.</p><p>Antonique Peterson was at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic while completing her family medicine residency.</p><p>She had two children who were four years and three months old at the time, and she acknowledges that this time was mentally taxing for her.</p><p>In June 2021, Patrick Peterson’s wife finished her residency. She works as a doctor in Minnesota and is the third doctor in the Larry family.</p><h3>Patrick Peterson signs a 2-year deal</h3><p>The Pittsburgh Steelers and free-agent cornerback Patrick Peterson have agreed to a two-year contract, according to a source who talked with ESPN’s Adam Schefter.</p><p>After spending the previous ten years with the Arizona Cardinals, where he won three All-Pro accolades and eight Pro Bowl selections, Peterson, who will turn 33 this summer, played the past two seasons with the Minnesota Vikings.</p><p>The Steelers’ interest “came out of left field,” according to Peterson, who discussed it with former Steelers CB Bryant McFadden on his podcast “All Things Covered” on Monday.</p><p>The Steelers are anticipated to sign Peterson, who is older than the team’s typical free agent signing, to replace veteran cornerback Cameron Sutton, who earlier on Monday agreed to a three-year contract with the Detroit Lions.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="patrick peterson net worth,patrick peterson parents,patrick peterson family,antonique peterson,patrick peterson salary,patrick peterson brother,patrick peterson wife,patrick peterson wife doctor,vikings patrick peterson wife,patrick esume net worth,pat gray wife,pat patterson wife" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
