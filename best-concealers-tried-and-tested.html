However, concealers have varying strengths and serve different purposes, from color-correcting hyperpigmentation to minimizing blemishes and brightening dark circles. Concealers with a radiant finish can also serve as highlighters, strategically catching the light to enhance your natural features. Other options toe the line between makeup and skincare, working to conceal imperfections while hydrating the skin with ingredients like vitamin E and botanical extracts.</p><p>Experts In This Article</p><ul class=!ml-[18px]><li>Carly Giglio, New York-based makeup artist and educator</li><li>Merav Adler, Los Angeles-based makeup artist and hairstylist</li></ul><p>It’s no wonder your average beauty editor has more than a few concealers in their arsenal, each one tailored to meet the needs of the day. Over the past six months, I’ve been able to test dozens of the best-selling concealers to give you an accurate account of which ones deserve the hype. In those months, I’ve been through hormonal breakouts, irritated skin from travel, aggravated under eyes from allergies, and more. Through it all, I’ve had a different concealer at the ready and a notepad in hand, ready to take notes on important elements like coverage, creasing, and length of wear. Metrics like hydration, blending, and durability played a major role in my decision, and I also factored in price point, ingredients, brand ethics, and user experience.</p><p><span class="inline text-h5 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>Further insight came when I found myself not thinking about this story, and merely reaching for one of the many, many concealers I had available. I started to keep track of which ones I unconsciously chose, wanted to use, and kept reaching for (or what I packed for a trip). I can confidently say that every single product on this list is a stellar option. I’m a firm believer that there’s no one product for every single person—each of these concealers has a different ingredient profile, different shades and undertones, and different finishes. Try a couple of them and see what works for you. You can’t go wrong with any of them.</p><h2 id=best-concealers-at-a-glance>Best concealers, at a glance</h2><ul><li><strong>Best overall: </strong>Charlotte Tilbury, Beautiful Skin Radiant Concealer, $33</li><li><strong>Best for under eyes: </strong>NYX, Bare With Me Concealer Serum, $12</li><li><strong>Best for blemishes: </strong>Clé de Peau, Beauté Concealer SPF 27, $75</li><li><strong>Best all-over concealer: </strong>Dior, Forever Skin Correct Concealer, $40</li><li><strong>Best for brightening: </strong>Makeup By Mario, SurrealSkin Awakening Concealer, $29</li><li><strong>Best concealer and corrector: </strong>Laura Mercier, Secret Camouflage, $39</li><li><strong>Best waterproof: </strong>Kylie Cosmetics, Power Plush Longwear Concealer, $27</li><li><strong>Best full coverage: </strong>Tarte, Shape Tape Ultra Creamy Concealer, $32</li><li><strong>Best buildable coverage: </strong>Chantecaille, Le Camouflage Stylo, $60</li><li><strong>Best matte coverage: </strong>Hourglass, Vanish Airbrush Concealer, $38</li><li><strong>Best for dry skin: </strong>Kosas, Revealer Concealer, $30</li><li><strong>Best budget: </strong>E.l.f., Hydrating Camo Concealer, $7</li><li><strong>Best for mature skin: </strong>L’Oréal, Age Perfect Radiant Concealer, $14</li><li><strong>Best for no-makeup makeup: </strong>Armani Beauty, Luminous Silk Face and Under-Eye Concealer, $42</li><li><strong>Best long-wearing: </strong>Nars, Radiant Creamy Concealer, $32</li><li><strong>Best non-silicone formula: </strong>Milk Makeup, Future Fluid, $29</li><li><strong>Best multi-use: </strong>Maybelline, Instant Age Rewind, $9</li></ul><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-a-concealer>What to look for in a concealer</h2><p>Choosing the best concealer for your unique skin type and tone is similar to finding your perfect foundation match. You’ll want to consider whether your skin is oily, dry, or a combination of the two, plus, you’ll want to factor in concerns like hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and blemishes.</p><p>New York-based celebrity makeup artist and educator Carly Giglio explains that this will inform the finish and coverage you should choose. “Think about the finish compared to your skin type: if your skin is dry, you’ll probably want a more radiant or creamy concealer as opposed to a matte concealer, which is ideal for oilier complexions.” She also notes that occasion is key. “Consider the applicator type and how that works with your needs and lifestyle. Are you looking to touch up your makeup on the go? A concealer stick is going to be better than a liquid product.” LA-based makeup artist Merav Adler adds that different concealers are tailored to different parts of the face. “Some concealers are better suited for under-eye concerns like dark circles, whereas others are designed to cover blemishes and dark spots,” she explains. “Consider the formula’s thickness, pigmentation, and undertones, as your skin tone and texture tend to vary across different parts of the face.”</p><h2 id=shop-the-best-concealers>Shop the best concealers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Charlotte-Tilbury-Beautiful-Skin-Radiant-Concealer_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best overall: Charlotte Tilbury, Beautiful Skin Radiant Concealer — $33.00</p><p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Medium to full | <strong>Available shades:</strong> 30 | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, vitamin C</p><p>Of all the concealers I’ve tested, this is the one I’ve been reaching for over and over again. Charlotte Tilbury’s Beautiful Skin is magic for under eyes, thanks to the radiant mica in the formulation, which adds a lit-from-within, luminous brightness. This creamy, ultra-hydrating formula is applied with an applicator that literally works like a magic wand to deliver gorgeous results. Coverage is medium (but buildable), and the combination of hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, vitamin C, and peptides makes this a ‘secret sauce’ for all-over brightening and spot treatments alike. It delivers a sort of blur-filter effect while also treating the skin with rich, potent ingredients.</p><ul><li>Radiant finish</li><li>Blurring “filter” effect</li><li>Packed with hydrating peptides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid</li><li>Long-wearing (up to 16 hours)</li></ul><ul><li>Radiant finish can read as glitter</li><li>May crease if you use too much</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NYX-Bare-With-Me-Hydrating-Face-Body-Concealer-Serum_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best for under eyes: NYX, Bare With Me Concealer Serum — $12.00</p><p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Medium | <strong>Available shades: </strong>17 | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Tremella mushroom, cica, green tea</p><p>This “serum” is exceptional and its brightening capabilities are second only to the sorcery of Charlotte Tilbury’s.

Please don’t shoot the messenger. If this is within your budget, the solid stick delivery of Clé de Peau’s concealer acts like an eraser for blemishes. I keep this one in my handbag because it’s easy to apply on the go and there’s no chance of an accidental spill. It’s better for oilier skin types and blemish coverage versus under-eye concealing, IMO. I also love that it’s formulated with sunscreen—a huge bonus.</p><ul><li>Convenient stick format</li><li>Smooth, blendable texture</li><li>Delivers full coverage with an airbrushed effect</li><li>Includes SPF</li></ul><ul><li>Pricey</li><li>Limited shade range</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dior-Forever-Skin-Correct-Full-Coverage-Concealer_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best all-over concealer: Dior, Forever Skin Correct Concealer — $40.00</p><p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Full | <strong>Available shades: </strong>30 | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Iris extract, wild pansy extract, nasturtium extract</p><p>Whether it’s a dark circle, scar, hyperpigmentation, or blemish, Dior’s Forever Skin is a versatile, creamy formulation that can cover it all. Using a soft wand applicator, you’ll get long-wear full coverage with an I-forgot-I-was-wearing-makeup feel. As any makeup artist will tell you, this concealer is super high-quality.

This brightening formula is beloved by makeup artists and was called out twice by the ones we spoke to for this story. “I love this concealer—it is a perfectly smooth, buttery consistency and blends beautifully,” says Giglio. “It doesn’t cake or move around, and the dewy finish looks so beautiful on the skin,” adds Adler. I personally love the way this concealer depuffs and tightens the under eyes, thanks to the caffeine in its creamy formula. It’s my go-to when I wake up with allergy-related puffiness or haven’t gotten a full 8 hours.</p><ul><li>Buildable coverage</li><li>Works well for blemishes and dark circles</li><li>Visibly reduces puffiness</li><li>Long-wearing, crease-proof formula that doesn’t budge</li></ul><ul><li>May crease if not blended properly</li><li>Highly pigmented, so be sure you have your correct match</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Laura-Mercier-Secret-Camouflage_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best concealer and corrector: Laura Mercier, Secret Camouflage — $39.00</p><p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Medium to full | <strong>Available shades:</strong> 8 | Key ingredients: Safflower seed oil, aloe barbadensis leaf extract</p><p>I bought this concealer for my boyfriend at the recommendation of a fellow beauty editor. He and his bandmates were making a music video at the time and needed some light blemish touch-ups before their shoot. Laura Mercier’s Secret Camouflage was the best possible pick for all four bandmates, thanks to its creamy, customizable palette, which suited their range of skin tones and left them looking naturally blemish-free. I’ve since nabbed this concealer for myself, and it’s a must-have when I need full coverage with a natural finish. My only call-out: make sure you fully close the compact! I’ve accidentally left it open before and the product went a bit dry.</p><ul><li>Customizable palette with both light and dark shades</li><li>8 versatile palettes allow for a diverse range of skin tones</li><li>Creamy texture with a natural finish</li><li>Full coverage for everything from blemishes to shadows and capillaries</li></ul><ul><li>Dries out easily if the compact is left open</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Kylie-Cosmetics-Power-Plush-Longwear-Concealer_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best waterproof: Kylie Cosmetics, Power Plush Longwear Concealer — $27.00</p><p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Full | <strong>Available shades:</strong> 40 | <strong>Key ingredients: </strong>Vitamin E, rose flower extract, panthenol (pro-vitamin B5)</p><p>Sometimes celebrities do know best, and Kylie Jenner certainly knows her makeup. Her Power Plush Longwear concealer is an excellent choice for days when sun, sweat, and water are factors that may derail your glam. The lightweight formula manages to be both hydrating and waterproof (a true feat in our book!) and blends beautifully with makeup to boot. “I use this long-wear concealer to cover blemishes and boost radiance before my clients step onto the red carpet,” says Adler. “It looks gorgeous on the skin and the shade range is amazing for all skin tones.”</p><ul><li>Hydrating, lightweight formula creates a dewy finish</li><li>Humidity- and water-proof</li><li>Doesn’t cake or crease</li><li>Formulated with skincare ingredients</li></ul><ul><li>Settles into fine lines around the eyes</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Tarte-Shape-Tape-Ultra-Creamy-Concealer_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best full coverage: Tarte, Shape Tape Ultra Creamy Concealer — $32.00</p><p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Full | <strong>Available shades:</strong> 36 | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Hyaluronic acid, prickly pear, ginseng, vegan squalane</p><p>The original Tarte Shape Tape is a crowd favorite, but lemme tell ya… the new hydrating one is better. The texture feels akin to a moisturizer, and thanks to the addition of prickly pear to the formula, you’ll get not just long wear, but long-lasting hydration. The new Ultra Creamy Shape Tape provides serious full coverage. Be mindful of this when applying, because you don’t need as much as you think. Despite being great for dry skin, it completely conceals acne as well. I found it to be helpful after using drying treatments like Differin or Avène Cleanance spot treatment—the hydrating element helped balance things out.</p><ul><li>Long-wearing full coverage</li><li>Vegan and cruelty-free formula</li><li>Hydrates skin for up to 24 hours</li><li>Ideal for dry and mature skin</li></ul><ul><li>Fragrance may irritate some skin types</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chantecaille-Le-Camouflage-Stylo.webp><p>Best buildable coverage: Chantecaille, Le Camouflage Stylo — $60.00</p><p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Light to medium | <strong>Available shades</strong>: 7 | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Titanium dioxide (SPF)</p><p>This is a beautiful paintbrush, and your face is the canvas waiting to be decorated. This formula provides a your-skin-but-better finish and easily blends into skin with or without foundation. You can truly wear this on its own, thanks to its flawless blend and light but buildable coverage. What I especially love about Chantecaille—and what makes the price a bit more digestible—is the brand’s ethics and commitment to creating environmentally friendly products.</p><ul><li>Silky texture</li><li>Effortlessly blends with makeup</li><li>Crease-free formulation</li><li>Doesn’t settle into fine lines</li></ul><ul><li>Click tube can be a little inconvenient</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hourglass-Vanish-Airbrush-Concealer_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best matte coverage: Hourglass, Vanish Airbrush Concealer — $38.00</p><p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Full | <strong>Available shades:</strong> 22 | <strong>Key ingredients: </strong>Camellia leaf extract, matricaria flower extract, licorice root extract, rosemary leaf extract, squalane</p><p>It was so tough to decide between Armani and Hourglass for the best “cloud skin-finish” concealer, but Hourglass came out on top thanks to the fact that its velvety, matte formula is super creamy and hydrating, despite leaving you with a more subdued (read: not dewy) result. A hydrating matte makeup product? It exists! I’ve used this concealer for years and can attest to its many virtues. Giglio agrees, sharing that it provides great coverage and easily glides onto skin. “Hourglass Vanish Airbrush Concealer is one of the most-used options in my makeup kit,” adds Adler. “It wears beautifully and comes in 22 shades inclusive of undertones such as neutral, pink, yellow, neutral pink, golden, peach, and red.”</p><ul><li>Great for dark circles and blemishes</li><li>Ideal for touch-ups on the go</li><li>Vegan, cruelty-free formula</li></ul><ul><li>May crease if you apply too much, so use sparingly!</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Kosas-Revealer-Super-Creamy-Brightening-Concealer-with-Caffeine-and-Hyaluronic-Acid_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best for dry skin: Kosas, Revealer Concealer — $30.00</p><p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Medium | <strong>Available shades: </strong>48 | <strong>Key ingredients: </strong>Caffeine, pink algae extract, hyaluronic acid, peptides</p><p>I initially borrowed this from a friend at a party when I needed an emergency blemish touch-up, and it was so good, I ran to Sephora the next day to pick one up for myself. It’s got medium coverage and is lush and hydrating, thanks to the hyaluronic acid and peptides, but it still works for covering a breakout. The versatility, again, comes down to ingredients. Caffeine and pink algae extract help revive your under eyes, while arnica and panthenol calm blemishes and redness.</p><ul><li>Excellent range of shades</li><li>Vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free</li><li>Highly pigmented formula brightens and covers blemishes</li><li>Ideal for concealing dark circles</li></ul><ul><li>May crease over time, especially if you have oily skin</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Elf-Hydrating-Camo-Concealer_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best budget: E.l.f., Hydrating Camo Concealer — $7.00</p><p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Full | <strong>Available shades:</strong> 20 | <strong>Key ingredients: </strong>Damask rose water, titanium dioxide</p><p>E.l.f. is truly in a category of its own. Whether you’re looking for hydration or full coverage, this stuff delivers, and at only $7 it is an A+++ budget buy. The Hydrating Camo Concealer costs less than what I spend on a single Starbucks coffee, is available in 25 shades, and is 100 percent cruelty-free and vegan. Sweat-proof, immovable, and impressively long-wear, this concealer works hard for the money. Also of note: the applicator is beefy—it’s large, plush, and dispenses a lot of product at a time.</p><ul><li>Full coverage with a satin finish</li><li>Lasts for up to 12 hours</li><li>Blendable and crease-resistant</li><li>Plush applicator tip</li><li>Vegan and cruelty-free formula</li></ul><ul><li>Formula tends to pool in the cap</li><li>Not transfer-resistant</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LOreal-Paris-Age-Perfect-Radiant-Concealer-with-Hydrating-Serum-and-Glycerin_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best for mature skin: L’Oréal, Age Perfect Radiant Concealer — $14.00</p><p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Medium | <strong>Available shades:</strong> 14 | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Caffeine, sunflower seed oil, titanium dioxide</p><p>If your concealer is always settling into the tiny lines around your eyes, consider L’Oréal’s Age Perfect formula. Using glycerin and a “hydrating serum,” this one won’t get caught up in those teensy skin folds when you squint or laugh—meaning it won’t leave you with a crepey or cakey appearance. It has a very small applicator that allows for a very precise application and creates a luminous finish.</p><ul><li>Serum formula is extra moisturizing</li><li>Brightens the under eyes without settling into lines</li><li>Small applicator allows for precise touch-ups</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Armani-Beauty-Luminous-Silk-Face-and-Under-Eye-Concealer_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best for no-makeup makeup: Armani Beauty, Luminous Silk Face and Under-Eye Concealer — $42.00</p><p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Light to medium | <strong>Available shades:</strong> 22 | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Caffeine, sunflower seed oil, titanium dioxide</p><p>A creamy, medium-coverage formula with glycerin, caffeine, and vitamin E leaves you with a “cloud skin,” satin finish (not dewy or glass skin!). For those with oilier complexions, this concealer is a must. And, despite having dryer skin myself, Armani’s Luminous Silk concealer didn’t feel cakey or flakey at any point during my several test wears (though I do topically hydrate quite a bit before applying makeup). “Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Concealer is very natural looking and gives that beautiful dewy, glowing skin,” says Adler. “I also love that the 22 shades are made with a variety of undertones in mind.”</p><ul><li>Provides up to 24 hours of medium coverage</li><li>Ideal for correcting blemishes and dark circles</li><li>Radiant finish makes skin look luminous</li></ul><ul><li>Radiant finish may read as sparkly on some skin tones</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nars-Radiant-Creamy-Concealer_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best long-wearing: Nars, Radiant Creamy Concealer — $32.00</p><p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Medium | <strong>Available shades: </strong>30 | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Magnolia bark extract, grape seed extract, vitamin E</p><p>This product needs no introduction. It’s been a long-time best seller, and I still love this stuff, even after all these years. Its creamy formula will give you excellent medium coverage and is available in 30 shades. I have found that the neutral shades lean yellow and warm-toned, and are a little more obvious on my decidedly neutral skin (to be fair, I haven’t tried the cool tones). That said, it’s sweat- and water-resistant, blendable and buildable, and all-around an excellent choice if you find the right color match!

But despite its reputation on TikTok as being a lightweight formula, it’s still a powerful product with medium coverage.

A little goes a long way, so this is truly a phenomenal value. With 18 shades and slightly warmer undertones, this is an ideal choice for warming up (and brightening) the bluish hues under your eyes. It’s not just a concealer, either—try out multiple shades to achieve an effortless contoured or highlighted look.</p><ul><li>Soft sponge tip makes for easy application</li><li>Handy tube format makes it easy to take on the go</li><li>Lightweight formula blends well with makeup</li><li>Lasts longer than most drugstore concealers</li><li>Oil and fragrance free</li></ul><ul><li>Watery, fluid formula might not be ideal for all</li><li>Includes alcohol, which can dry out skin</li></ul><h2 id=should-you-apply-concealer-before-or-after-foundation>Should you apply concealer before or after foundation?</h2><p>While there are no set rules concerning when to apply concealer, we recommend dabbing it on after your foundation is set. Whenever I have a blemish that still looks a bit red or raised after my foundation is on, I like to spot-treat with a small amount of concealer, let it set for about a minute, and then gently blend the area with a brush or the small end of a makeup sponge. Giglio and Adler agree that concealer is best applied after foundation as well. “Think of your foundation as a base,” Giglio explains. “If you still have noticeable blemishes or dark spots after it’s set, you’ll be able to cover them with less concealer than you would if you applied the concealer first.” This also allows you to use less product overall, which allows your skin to breathe and heal. “I prefer to apply concealer after foundation because it works better when brightening the under eyes,” Adler adds.</p><h2 id=should-a-concealer-be-lighter-or-darker-than-my-skin-tone>Should a concealer be lighter or darker than my skin tone?</h2><p>There are multiple ways to use concealer, whether you’re looking to correct redness, cover blemishes and dark spots, or highlight and contour your features. “For under eyes, I suggest using a concealer that’s one to two shades lighter than your skin to help brighten the area,” says Giglio. “For spot-concealing on the face, you want to get something closer to your skin tone. You can also use a concealer that’s two to three shades darker than your skin tone to create a more sculpted look.”</p><h2 id=what-concealer-covers-everything>What concealer covers everything?</h2><p>Everyone’s skin is different, which means the best full-coverage concealer will vary based on your unique skin type and concerns. That said, Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer ($32), Tarte Shape Tape Ultra Creamy Concealer ($32), and Makeup By Mario SurrealSkin Awakening Concealer ($29) are all superb full-coverage options that easily conceal everything from dark circles and redness to blemishes and hyperpigmentation. “From the concealers I have personally used, I do think that NARS gives great coverage both on under eyes and on the face,” says Giglio. Meanwhile, Adler swears by Tarte Shape Tape and Makeup by Mario concealers, which provide creamy, hydrating coverage that lasts all day.</p><p>Our editors independently select these products.
