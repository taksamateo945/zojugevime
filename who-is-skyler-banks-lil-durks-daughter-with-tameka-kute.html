The exact location of her birth in the United States is unknown but she is undoubtedly an American citizen because she was born in the country.</p><p>Skyler is currently 9 years old and is the fifth child of her father. As of 2022, she is one of 6 children born to the rapper whose dating history reads like a phonebook. She is a product of her father’s romantic alliance with a woman known as Tameka Kute.</p><p>Skyler’s African American heritage shines brightly through both her parents’ ethnic identities as African Americans and her unmistakable caramel skin tone. Not much is known about her mother who it appears has chosen to live her life away from the media and public scrutiny that comes with being in the spotlight.</p><p>Several reports have revealed that she is quite passionate about the fashion industry and that passion appears to have rubbed off on her daughter. Details of Skyler’s formal education are unknown at the moment but one would expect that that particular aspect of her life would become clearer as the years go by.</p><h2><strong>Skyler Banks’ Parents Were Never Married</strong></h2><p>Lil Durk’s relationship with Skyler’s mother, Tameka Kute, may have been relatively short-lived but it has not prevented people from wanting to know more about the daughter he had with her.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/Tameka.jpg alt="Skyler Banks" width=696 height=527 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Several sources have revealed that the two people responsible for bringing Skyler into this world were friends for a long time before they decided to step things up a notch and engage in a romantic relationship. The timeline of their relationship has, however, not been accurately established but that relationship led to the birth of Skyler in August 2014.</p><p>Skyler’s birth allegedly put some strain on the couple’s relationship because they started having issues shortly after. Even though they tried to focus on the new life they had just created, it was not enough to keep them together and they reportedly went their separate ways shortly after the birth of their daughter.</p><p>The prevailing cause of their break-up was Lil Durk’s philandering lifestyle. While they were together, Lil Durk was always in the news for hooking up with other women, a behavior that consistently put him at loggerheads with Skyler’s mother.</p><p>Tameka could not put up with the disrespect and humiliation that she suffered because of his infidelity and as a result, she ended things with the rapper. While not exactly friends with each other, Skyler’s parents have maintained a civil and cordial relationship while they co-parent their child, who primarily resides with her mother.</p><h2><strong>Skyler Banks’s Siblings Are 5</strong></h2><p>We can confirm that Skyler Banks is the only child her parents had while their relationship lasted. And despite being relatively away from the spotlight, nothing about her mother suggests that she (Tameka) had or has another child with Lil Durk or any other person.</p><p>However, Skyler is not her father’s only child. The rapper has discernibly been involved with several other women prior to and after romantically linking up with Skyler’s mother. Some of those relationships have also produced children who have invariably become Skyler’s half-siblings. Let’s take a cursory look at who they are.</p><h3><strong>Angelo Banks</strong></h3><p>Skyler’s oldest half-sibling is her half-brother Angelo Banks. Angelo was born on November 29, 2011, to Lil Durk and his ex-wife Nicole Covone. Angelo’s parents had reportedly met in high school and commenced their romantic relationship in 2008. About 3 years later, they welcomed Angelo who was born when Lil Durk was only 19 years old. Angelo’s parents were not married at the time of his birth but they took care of that shortly before his sister was born.</p><h3><strong>Bella Banks</strong></h3><p>Skyler’s dad and his ex-wife, Nicole, got married in 2013. Not long after, they welcomed a second child together who they named <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bella Banks</a>. Bella was born on July 19, 2013, just about a year before Skyler was born. The marriage between Lil Durk and Nicole Covone ended a few months after Bella’s birth, presumably on the grounds of infidelity on the rapper’s part.</p><h3><strong>Zayden Banks</strong></h3><p>Lil Durk’s infidelity towards his ex-wife, Nicole, became evident on November 5, 2013, the date on which he welcomed his son Zayden Banks with a woman who was not Nicole. The identity of Zayden’s mother is unknown at the moment but it is apparent that she wants nothing to do with the limelight.</p><h3><strong>Du’mier Banks</strong></h3><p>Du’mier Banks was born in 2014. His exact date of birth is yet to be known but reports have suggested that he is the rapper’s fourth child, the implication being that he is a few months older than Skyler. Like Zayden, there is very little information about the woman who gave birth to Du’mier, but there’s no doubt that they share the same father.</p><h3><strong>Willow Banks</strong></h3><p>Willow Banks, Skyler’s youngest half-sibling, was born in 2018. Willow’s mother is an Instagram influencer and model known as <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>India Royale</a>. Willow’s parents started dating in 2017, had Willow in 2018, and got engaged on December 18, 2021. They have reportedly broken up after their mini meltdown on social media. Willow is 5 years old.</p><h3><strong>Skyler Banks Is Active On Social Media</strong></h3><p>Following in the footsteps of several celebrity kids who are on various social media platforms, managed by their parents, of course, Skyler Banks is quite active on Instagram where she has 2 different handles. The first one @skylarrbanks has just over 90 followers while the second and likely the main account @skybanks16 has more than 6k followers even though it’s been set to private.</p><p>Skyler posts fashion-related content, including a solitary picture of herself in fashion outfits, which in all likelihood was selected by her mother, who is trying to make a fashion model out of her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmarm665pr6Mm5ino6Niuaq4jJ2sq6OjYrGiwcahq56qXay2tbSMrZimnZuWeqzB055m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cartoonist-joe-matt-death-news-obituary-what-happened.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cartoonist Joe Matt Death News And Obituary: What Happened To Him?">&larr;
