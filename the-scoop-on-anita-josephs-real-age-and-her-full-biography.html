Anita has once received an Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award as Actress of The Year.</span></p><h2><strong>What else does She do Apart from Acting?</strong></h2><p>Like many actors and actresses in the Nigerian entertainment industry and indeed celebrities in the country and worldwide, Anita has diversified her income sources by investing in businesses and leveraging her good public image to promote brands (their products and services) who can foot her bill.</p><h3><strong>She is a Businesswoman</strong></h3><p><span>Aside from her burgeoning acting career, Anita Joseph is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hourglass Fashion World, a retail store for waist trainers, gym belts, butt lifters, and other figure enhancement accessories. The brand is familiar to many high-class women who want to get a finely curved waist.

She gave birth to her in December 2015, but the paternity of the child is currently unknown. Aside from her daughter, which there are pictures on the internet to ascertain that she does exist, Anita is also said to have a son named Michael, which speculation is yet to be denied or confirmed by her. The boy is about 12 years old, as he is believed to have been born in 2011.</p><p><span>Though now married, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>several speculations</a> and controversies have surrounded Anita’s love life in the past.

The marriage reportedly lasted for about three years and ended childlessly.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>Anita Joseph’s Popularity and Social Media Presence</strong></h3><p><span>Anita has a large following on Instagram, currently numbering just over two million, which explains the heavy patronage she receives as a brand ambassador. She is fondly called “Mother Hen” among her fans for her love and support for Nigerian crossdresser <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bobrisky</a>.

Her racy Instagram pictures, videos, and comments about her relationship with her husband, MC Fish, have also given people a lot to talk about. Once, she made a post expressing regrets about her six body ink marks, saying that she was not aware that tattooing was sinful when she was inscribing them.</span></p><p><span>This, too, caused a bit of a stir among her fans. </span><span>Despite all of these, Anita Joseph continues to maintain a healthy and acceptable public image. She remains a screen favorite for many Nigerian movie enthusiasts.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK5706GcZquTpLyxec6nZJqmmamubrbOrJypoKNiv6aty2aYoJ1dlruleceeqWaepaG5bq7IqJ6rmaCdxnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./will-ferrell-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Ferrell Net Worth: How the Comedian Became One of the Richest Actors in Hollywood">&larr;
