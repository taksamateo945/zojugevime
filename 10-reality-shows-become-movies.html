The show’s combination of competition, dedication, and suspense make it a great candidate for a shot at the big screen.</p><p>(Photo by Andrew H.

From 2009 to 2012, MTV’s Jersey Shore gave spending summers at the beach an entirely new meaning. &nbsp;As a film, Jersey Shore could follow the cast through an epic night of partying and drinking all while trying to make it back to the house in one piece.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/98867281.jpg alt='"The Harsh Truth: Teen Moms Tell All" Sposored By The Candie&#39;s Foundation' width=642 height=416 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Teen Mom</strong></p><p>There is something extremely compelling about a group of young mothers doing their best to provide for the children. &nbsp;MTV’s Teen Mom has captured the attention of millions by telling these stories in a way that allows viewers to feel a connection to the young girls by following them over the course of several years. &nbsp;On the big screen, these stories could be told without having to actually follow a group of people for a long period of time.</p><p>(Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/107690865.jpg alt='CBS&#39; "Survivor: Nicaragua" Finale & Reunion Party' width=640 height=531 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Survivor</strong></p><p>Survivor is one of the longest running reality TV shows on the air. &nbsp;However, despite its success, many viewers are turned off by the deceit and trickery that often arises as people compete to stay on the island. &nbsp;In the film version of Survivor, viewers would be able to enjoy the entertaining aspects, without having to feel that human nature was being exploited to cause harm to actual people.</p><p>(Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/186163189.jpg alt='VH1 "Love & Hip Hop" Season 4 Premiere' width=642 height=453 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Love & Hip Hop</strong></p><p>There’s so much more to VH1’s Love & Hip Hop than just love and hip-hop. &nbsp;In many ways, the show has captured the essence of what it’s like to try to build relationships and a successful career at the same time. &nbsp;Quite often, the show’s cast members struggle to find the balance necessary to accomplish their dreams, and along the way there is plenty of drama.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Brian Ach/Getty Images for Vh1)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/149093036.jpg alt="Teen Choice Awards 2012 - Arrivals" width=642 height=429 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Dance Moms</strong></p><p>Lifetime’s Dance Moms has become a hit in the nearly four years it’s been on the air. However, although the show was originally intended to focus on the young girls and their mothers, dance company owner, Abby Lee Miller, quickly became the show’s star. &nbsp;As a film, the story might be better told from the perspective of the girls who are being trained by Miller. &nbsp;With her painted as the villain, there would be plenty of opportunities for humor and drama.</p><p>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/165397032.jpg alt="2013 Bravo New York Upfront" width=641 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</strong></p><p>The cast of Bravo’s Real Housewives of Atlanta are perhaps one of the most entertaining groups on&nbsp;reality TV. Almost each week, the&nbsp;cast, made up of six Atlanta-based women, goes back and forth between being friends and enemies. &nbsp;Along the way, viewers get to know each woman’s personality, and often find themselves picking sides when arguments arise on the show. &nbsp;Although many people feel like The Real Housewives of Atlanta is nothing more than a reality TV cat fight, fans of the show would love to see their favorite cast members brought to life on the big screen.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/139060825.jpg alt='Karen Gravano&#39;s "Mob Daughter" Book Release Party At Greenhouse' width=640 height=538 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Mob Wives</strong></p><p>Mob movies have always been a big hit at the box office, and VH1’s Mob Wives would be no different. &nbsp;The all-female cast would put a unique spin on a genre that has a history of being dominated by men. The central characters, each of whom has their own larger-than-life personality, would be a perfect fit for the big screen as they argue (usually) over nothing, and douse each other with expensive drinks.</p><p>(Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/452820090.jpg alt="2014 Young Hollywood Awards Brought To You By Samsung Galaxy" width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>The Bachelor</strong></p><p>Everybody loves a good love story, and what better reality TV love story is there than ABC’s The Bachelor? With the perfect Hollywood stars selected as cast members, The Bachelor movie could easily win over a large audience looking to be entertained by a romantic movie in which a handsome man weeds through a dozen single ladies to find the woman of his dreams.</p><p>(Photo by Ari Perilstein/Getty Images for Variety)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWimq6ttdOyZKygn6zAbq7EnKamnV2ivLe1xKxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mother-of-ten-shares-eye-opening-video-of-herself-meal-prepping-for-her-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mother of TEN shares eye-opening video of herself meal prepping for her kids">&larr;
