pairs.</p><p>Their acting prowess has led to successful and enduring careers that have spanned over three decades.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the narrative of their triumph would be incomplete without acknowledging the substantial influence and support of their parents.</p><h2><span id=Who_are_Tia_and_Tamera_parents>Who are Tia and Tamera parents?</span></h2><p>Tia and Tamera Mowry, born on 6 July 1978 in Germany, have an intriguing background when it comes to their parents.</p><p>Their father, Timothy John Mowry, was born on 4 January 1957 and is of white American

Darlene Mowry, is still alive, dispelling any rumors suggesting otherwise.</p><p>There were false speculations about her passing due to her absence from the public eye for five years.</p><p>However, she put those rumors to rest by announcing her involvement as a producer in the Hollywood industry.</p><p>Currently 66 years old, she continues to contribute her talents and expertise.</p><p>The story of Timothy and Darlene began during their high school years in Miami, Florida, where they first crossed paths.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Divorce?</span></h2><p>The divorce of Tia and Tamera Mowry’s parents is a well-known fact, but what led to the separation?</p><p>According to Tia, it was her <a href=#>father’s infidelity</a> that caused the split.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>, Tia disclosed that she discovered her father’s affair when she was just a young child.</p><p>She vividly remembers coming home from school to find her mother in tears at the kitchen table.</p><p>Tia asked her mother what was wrong, and that’s when she learned about her father’s unfaithfulness.</p><p>At the time, Tia was only six years old, but the revelation had a significant impact on her.</p><p>She admitted that the moment changed her life because, until then, she believed her family was perfect.</p><p>However, after that day, things were never the same.</p><p>The divorce took a toll on both Tia and Tamera, who were seven and five years old, respectively, when their parents separated.</p><p>Tamera shared her perspective on the difficult experience in an interview with <a href=#>Essence magazine</a>.</p><p>She expressed how challenging it was for her to witness her parents going through such a tough time.</p><p>Even as an adult, it would have been challenging, so as a child, the impact was even greater.</p><p>Thankfully, Tia and Tamera had each other for support during this trying period.</p><p>They relied on their close bond as sisters to navigate the difficulties that came with growing up in a broken home.</p><p>However, through their unwavering sisterly support, they managed to overcome the challenges and maintain a strong bond that continues to this day.</p><h2><span id=Tia_and_Tamera_parents_impact_on_their_career>Tia and Tamera parents impact on their career</span></h2><p>Both Timothy and Darlene played pivotal roles in paving the way for Tia and Tamera’s achievements.</p><p>Darlene Mowry, Tia and Tamera’s mother, initially took the initiative to introduce Tia to the world of print modeling and commercial projects.</p><p>Recognizing her daughter’s potential, she went a step further by taking Tia to Los Angeles in hopes of securing her a role in a commercial or a television show.</p><p>Darlene was serving in the military at the time, it was not a simple task for her to uproot the family and relocate to pursue their dreams.</p><p>She had to make a compelling case in court, advocating for the opportunity to move to Hollywood.</p><p>Eventually, the court granted her request, allowing Darlene and the children to make the move, while Timothy had to remain behind.</p><p><br>This significant move enabled the Mowry twins to immerse themselves fully in the entertainment industry, providing them with opportunities to showcase their talents.</p><p>Tia and Tamera have graced numerous television shows and films throughout their careers, including notable works such as “Twitches Too,” “Tia & Tamera,” and “Seventeen Again.”</p><p>Additionally, during the early 1990s, the twins formed a singing group known as Voices, showcasing their musical abilities.</p><p>The unwavering support and determination of both Timothy
